<h2 align="left"><strong>What is this?</strong></h2>
<div align="left">

**EvoSec-Lab** is an isolated design and testing orchestration stage for Network Topologies, Security Measures & **Project Controls Workflows**.  

Enterprise-grade hardware, **Complex** network topologies, & Robust workflows integrated seamlessly.  

This lab serves as a hands-on playground for experimentation, learning, and proof-of-concept development, combining hardware, software, and automation in realistic, production-like scenarios.

---

<h3 align="left"><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></h3>

- **Enterprise-Grade Simulation**  
  Realistic network environments featuring racks, switches, and firewalls designed to mirror production-grade infrastructures.

- **Project Controls Workflows**  
  Structured processes for planning, monitoring, and managing complex IT and network operations.

- **Security Experimentation**  
  Controlled deployment of honeypots, tar pits, and monitoring systems for safe and practical security research.

- **Automation & Orchestration**  
  Integration of LLM and SaltStack to dynamically manage infrastructure and maintain operational consistency.

- **Isolated Testing Environment**  
  A fully contained lab that enables risk-free experimentation without any impact on live systems.

- **Thorough Documentation**  
  Detailed notes, diagrams, and procedures ensuring all setups are transparent, reproducible, and verifiable.

<h3 align="left"><strong>With full operational maturity, the lab now operates as a dynamic, self-regulating security environment.</strong></h2>

The interplay here is complex, but charted here is a naive approach:

  System architecture showing compute, storage, and network topology. Application VMs run critical services on isolated VLANs, while honeypots and tar pits detect and slow threats. 
  SaltStack orchestrates real-time network adjustments, moving VMs and activating traps as needed. 
  LLM-driven analytics are reacting to the logs, anticipating attacks, and dynamically adjusting the network topology.</i></p>

- Designed every security zone and policy from scratch  
- Stood up Proxmox, ASA, SonicWall, Suricata, SELKS  
- Authored the entire documentation suite and runbooks  
- Still adding features at 2 a.m. because it’s fun
