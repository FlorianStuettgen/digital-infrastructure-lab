# Digital infrastructure Lab
![](/assets/photos/test2.jpeg)

**Digital infrastructure Lab** is a self-hosted security and infrastructure lab built on enterprise hardware and operated like a small production network. It is designed, built, and documented end to end by a single operator as a long-term R&D and learning platform.

> [!TIP]
> ### For recruiters / hiring managers
> This project demonstrates my ability to:
> - Design and operate a segmented, enterprise-style network on Proxmox and legacy enterprise gear.  
> - Implement ASA/SonicWall firewalls, VPNs, IDS/IPS (Suricata/SELKS), and centralized logging.  
> - Document architectures, runbooks, and change management so someone else could understand, rebuild, or operate the environment.
>   
I use this lab to prototype security, monitoring, and operations ideas that I later bring into my professional work.

It combines:

 - Proxmox virtualization
 - Dell server and storage platforms
 - Cisco ASA and SonicWall security appliances
 - VLAN-based segmentation on a managed switch
 - Centralized logging and IDS/IPS with NST/SELKS and Suricata

The lab is isolated from production networks and is used to design, test, and operate realistic network and security topologies.

## 🌐 Logical Architecture

The network is segmented into distinct zones. Each zone maps to one or more VLANs on the Dell X1052P and to specific policies on the ASA.

### Zones (Sanitized)

| Zone        | Role                                              |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Management | Switch, firewalls, console, iDRAC, SOC node       |
| Core       | Proxmox host(s), storage, shared infrastructure   |
| DMZ        | Externally reachable lab services                 |
| Lab        | General-purpose workloads and test VMs            |
| Honeypots  | Intentionally exposed services for observation    |
| Guest      | Untrusted devices and temporary clients           |

The Dell X1052P switch provides **Layer 2 separation** for each VLAN.  
**Inter-VLAN routing and filtering** are performed on the ASA, not on the switch.

---

### Traffic Flows (Conceptual)

| Flow                         | Purpose                                           | Controls                                                |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Internet ↔ ASA ↔ DMZ         | Public-facing services and exposure tests        | ASA ACLs, NAT, logging                                  |
| Internet ↔ ASA/SRA ↔ Mgmt    | Remote administration over VPN                   | VPN profiles, restricted subnets, authentication        |
| Lab / Guest ↔ ASA ↔ Internet | Outbound access for tools and clients            | Restricted egress rules, logging                        |
| Honeypots ↔ ASA ↔ Internet   | Inbound scans/attacks to honeypot zone           | Controlled inbound; tightly limited outbound            |
| Mgmt ↔ Other zones           | Admin access to infrastructure                   | Protocol + host-specific ACLs on ASA                    |

Exact IP addressing and VLAN IDs are documented in sanitized form in:

- `docs/02-network-architecture.md`

---

### Addressing Approach (Sanitized)

- Each zone uses a **distinct RFC1918 subnet** (for example, `/24` ranges per zone).
- The **ASA is the default gateway** for all VLANs.
- The Dell X1052P operates in **L2 mode only** (no L3 SVIs used for routing).
- Management IPs for infrastructure (switch, firewalls, iDRAC, console, SOC node) live exclusively in the **Management subnet**.
- Public address examples and NAT mappings use **documentation ranges** only (e.g., `198.51.100.0/24`, `203.0.113.0/24`).

---

## 🔒 Security & Monitoring

Security and observability are part of the base design, not an afterthought.

### Perimeter & Segmentation

**Cisco ASA appliances:**

- Define interface roles:
  - `outside`, `management`, `core`, `dmz`, `lab`, `honeypots`, `guest`
- Apply NAT rules:
  - Public-facing services in the DMZ
  - Outbound access from lab, guest, and honeypot zones
- Enforce ACLs that:
  - Explicitly permit required inter-zone traffic
  - Deny and log everything else by default

**SonicWall SRA 4200:**

- Terminates remote VPN sessions
- Exposes only:
  - Selected management subnets
  - Optional lab subnets for remote work
- Uses authentication and restricted routing to avoid broad access

Administrative interfaces for core infrastructure devices are reachable **only** from the management zone.

---

### Logging, DPI, and SOC Node

The Toughbook CF-30, running NST/SELKS (including Suricata), acts as a compact SOC node.

It:

- Receives:
  - Syslog from ASA and SonicWall
  - Logs from selected hosts and core services
  - Mirrored traffic from key switch ports and/or ASA interfaces
- Provides:
  - Deep packet inspection with Suricata
  - Dashboards and alert views through the SELKS stack

Monitoring design focuses on a limited set of well-chosen mirror points:

- Example: DMZ ↔ Internet, Honeypots ↔ Internet  
- Goal: capture **high-value** traffic paths rather than all traffic

Additional detail is documented in:

- `docs/03-security-architecture.md`

### How to Navigate

- Start with: `docs/00_overview.md` – narrative overview of the lab
- Then: `docs/02-network-architecture.md` – network layout, VLANs, and flows
- And: `docs/03-security-architecture.md` – security model and monitoring

### Automation & Config Artifacts

The `infra/` directory collects examples of how the environment is configured and automated conceptually:

- `example-firewall-policies/asa-lab-base-policy.txt` – base ASA policy structure for the lab environment.
- `sample-ansible-playbooks/` – conceptual Ansible examples for provisioning and configuration.
- `scripts/` – utility scripts for recurring tasks and experiments.

These artifacts are intentionally generic and sanitized, but they illustrate the structure and approach used to manage the environment.

## 🎯 Relevance to Roles

This project is designed to be more than a homelab showcase; it is a portfolio artifact that overlaps with several role types.

### Security / Network / Infrastructure Engineering

- Demonstrates hands-on experience with:
  - Firewalling (Cisco ASA), VPNs (SonicWall SRA), and segmented network design.
  - Building and operating a multi-VLAN, multi-zone environment with clear trust boundaries.
  - Centralized logging, IDS/IPS, and practical trade-offs around monitoring coverage.

### DevOps / Platform / SRE

- Shows:
  - A focus on reproducibility and documentation over ad-hoc configuration.
  - A foundation for infrastructure-as-code and automated provisioning (e.g., Ansible samples, structured configs).
  - A realistic lab for failure testing, exposure tests, and topology changes before applying similar ideas in production.

### Data / Analytics / Project Controls (Technical Focus)

- Highlights:
  - Systems thinking and comfort with complex technical environments.
  - A disciplined approach to change management, observability, and root-cause investigation.
  - The ability to translate messy infrastructure into structured documentation and repeatable processes.

---

## ⚙️ Operations

The lab is operated with the expectation that it will evolve and occasionally be rebuilt.

- **Backups**
  - Device configurations and Proxmox VM backups are taken regularly (stored outside this repository).
  - Backup and restore procedures are tracked under `docs/05-operations-and-maintenance.md`.

- **Change Tracking**
  - Topology and policy changes are reflected in the relevant `docs/` files.
  - Each significant change is summarized in `runbooks/change-log.md`.

- **Experiments**
  - New services, exposure tests, or honeypot configurations are:
    - Introduced in the lab
    - Documented so the logical design stays aligned with reality

The goal is for the lab to remain understandable and reproducible rather than drifting into an ad-hoc configuration.

---

## 👤 My Role in This Project

This lab is a **solo-built** environment:

- I sourced, racked, and cabled the hardware.
- I designed the network, security zones, and addressing scheme.
- I configured the hypervisor, firewalls, VPNs, monitoring stack, and management access.
- I wrote the documentation, diagrams, and operational runbooks in this repository.

The intent is to reflect how I approach real-world environments: start from clear boundaries and objectives, build for observability and safety, and document so others can understand, operate, and extend the system.

---

## 🧼 Sanitization & Scope

All content in this repository is intentionally sanitized:

- IP ranges, hostnames, and network object names are **examples**, not live values.
- No keys, credentials, VPN profiles, or other secrets are committed.
- Hardware identifiers such as serial numbers and MAC addresses are omitted.
- Configuration examples (such as `asa-lab-base-policy.txt`) are **structural** only and cannot be applied 1:1 to any real environment.

The lab is isolated from any production or customer systems.  
Honeypot and exposure testing is confined to this environment and configured to avoid unintended impact on external networks.
