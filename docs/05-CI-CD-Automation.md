# 05 – CI/CD & Automation

SOC_Replay integrates automation and CI/CD pipelines to ensure lab reproducibility, rapid deployment, and consistent configuration management.

## Automation Goals

- Automatic provisioning of VMs/containers  
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) management  
- Automated deployment of software/services, honeypots, and monitoring agents  
- Automated patching, updates, scaling, and rollback via snapshots  
- Automated containment or reconfiguration on detected threats  

## Example Workflow

1. Define infrastructure in IaC configuration  
2. Trigger pipeline → Provision VMs/containers → Deploy services/honeypots/IDS agents → Apply configuration  
3. Continuous monitoring → Automated containment if anomalies are detected  
4. Logging & telemetry → Review results → Optional rollback via snapshot
