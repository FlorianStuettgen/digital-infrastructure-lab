# 02 – Hardware

EvoSec runs on enterprise-grade servers with storage, networking, and virtualization capabilities to host multiple VMs, containers, and support flexible reconfiguration.  

## Typical Hardware Setup

- **Server Chassis** — high-performance CPUs, abundant RAM, and high-speed storage for virtualization and containerized workloads.  
- **Network Switches/Routers** — support VLAN segmentation, dynamic reconfiguration, and high-throughput traffic management.  
- **Storage Arrays** — for VM images, snapshots, logging data, and sandboxed environments.  
- **Networking Infrastructure** — enables DMZs, internal segmentation, honeypots, tar-pits, and secure management zones.  
- **Redundancy & Failover** — optional power supplies, network links, and RAID configurations to ensure uptime during experiments.  

This hardware ensures EvoSec can handle complex cybersecurity experiments, multi-VM simulations, and IoT-device testing while maintaining isolation, performance, and reliability.
