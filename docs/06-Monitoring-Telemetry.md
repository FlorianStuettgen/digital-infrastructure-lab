# 06 – Monitoring & Telemetry

Observability is core to SOC_Replay. Metrics and logs are collected at multiple layers to enable deep insight into activity and threats.

## Monitoring Layers

- **Infrastructure Metrics** — CPU, memory, storage I/O, VM/container usage  
- **Network Traffic & DPI** — analyze flows, detect anomalies, suspicious patterns  
- **Security Events & Alerts** — IDS/IPS, honeypots, unauthorized access attempts  
- **Logging & Aggregation** — central logging stack for all devices  
- **Dashboards & Visualization** — real-time dashboards showing system health and anomalies
